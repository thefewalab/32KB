# 32KB Arduino Trainer Kit

Arduino trainer kit is self-sustained training solution that allows the user to learn, understand and teaches wide range of hobbyist as well as an academician. This is one stop solution to have an opportunity to learn wide range of sensors, actuators with allowing individual to add on the sensors they desire with an interfaces that we provide in the kit. The kit can be powered via an adaptor with 5v inputs externally or with the USB cables during programming.
